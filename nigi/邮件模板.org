Subject: Request for Removal of Block on IP 51.83.132.203

Dear Team,

I am writing to request the removal of a block / blacklist entry affecting email sent from my server.

Affected IP address(es):

IPv4: 51.83.132.203

IPv6: 2001:41d0:601:1100::592a

Server / Hostname:

mail.yumieko.com

VPS at OVHcloud (vps-50015373)

Recently, I was informed that spam or abusive messages were being sent from this server and that the IP has been blocked / blacklisted as a result. I take this issue very seriously and have conducted a full investigation.

Root cause of the issue:
The problem was caused by a misconfiguration of my mail server which unintentionally allowed unauthorized email relaying within the internal Docker / network environment.
This configuration error was exploited to send spam messages from my server.
Importantly, I have checked the mail logs and found no evidence of SASL account compromise (no unauthorized authenticated logins).

Corrective actions taken:
I have already taken the following steps to stop the abuse and prevent it from happening again:
- Immediately stopped the mail service once the issue was reported.
- Cleared the outgoing mail queue to remove any remaining spam messages.
- Identified and corrected the mail relay configuration, so that:
- Only authenticated users and trusted local services can send mail.

The server no longer acts as an open or overly permissive relay under any circumstances.
- Updated credentials used by web applications and any services that send email through the server.
- Disabled unnecessary mail-related services and ports (such as POP3 and other unused services) and reduced the attack surface.
- Currently only the following ports are open from the mail side: 22, 587 and 993.
- Reviewed logs for any further suspicious activity and cleaned up any potentially malicious scripts or misuse.
- Enabled ongoing monitoring of mail logs, server processes, and outbound mail volume to quickly detect any anomalies in the future.
- Outbound connections to TCP port 25 are now restricted and monitored.

Current status
At this time, the server has been secured and the misconfiguration that allowed spam to be sent has been fully resolved.
I am committed to maintaining a clean, non-abusive mail environment and to complying with your anti-spam policies.

Request
- Given the corrective actions taken and the current secure configuration of the server, I kindly request that you:
- Remove the block / blacklist entry associated with the IP 51.83.132.203
- And, if applicable, the IPv6 2001:41d0:601:1100::592a and the hostname mail.yumieko.com

If you require any additional information, logs or confirmation from my hosting provider (OVHcloud), I will be happy to provide it.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and for your efforts in fighting spam and abuse.

Best regards,
